ScanEx project

This small project is a demonstration of how to merge a barcodescanner (of a product) and the picture (of that product) into one Android app.
The application allows you to take a picture from something, scan a barcode of that something, put it all in a filename and upload the picture to a server using https request.
For this example I've created a php script on Apache webserver to deal with the upload but any server can do the job.
